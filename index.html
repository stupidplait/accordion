                            If you have chosen a ready-made design from our catalog and want to make changes to
                            colors or types of materials, just let us know - we will take this into account in the

                                I liked the design of the bathroom with a shower, but we will definitely have a
                                bathtub in our apartment. Can it be replaced?

                            Yes, of course, we use the same combinations of materials, colors and textures, but we
                            use a bath or shower at your request.

                            For each room we provide a list of materials used, names of paints, descriptions and
                            names of furniture. And also a separate sheet with a list of suppliers from whom you can
                            buy everything.

                            Without drawings, builders will do the work at their discretion and most likely you will
                            have to constantly correct them. It is unlikely that you want to specify a place for
                            each of the 40 outlets manually. For you, drawings are a tool for monitoring repairs,
                            and for builders - a guarantee that they do everything the way you need.
